### Application outages
Scenario to block the traffic ( Ingress/Egress ) of an application matching the labels for the specified duration of time to understand the behavior of the service/other services which depend on it during downtime. This helps with planning the requirements accordingly, be it improving the timeouts or tweaking the alerts etc.
