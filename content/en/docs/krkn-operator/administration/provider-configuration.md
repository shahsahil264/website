# Provider Configuration <a href="/docs/krkn-operator/#permission-model"><span class="krkn-badge krkn-badge--admin">Admin</span></a>

Configure target providers that integrate with external cluster management platforms. The provider configuration interface adapts dynamically based on the selected provider.

## Cloud Provider Configuration

Some chaos scenarios interact directly with cloud infrastructure and require cloud provider credentials (AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack, etc.) to perform node-level operations. The following scenarios are not currently available in Krkn Operator until cloud provider configuration support is added:

| Scenario | Why Cloud Provider Is Required |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| **node-scenarios** | Stops, terminates, or reboots nodes via the cloud provider API |
| **node-scenarios-bm** | Controls bare metal nodes via BMC/IPMI credentials |
| **power-outages** | Shuts down and restarts the entire cluster through the cloud provider |
| **zone-outages** | Simulates availability zone failures by manipulating cloud network resources |

{{% notice warning %}}
Cloud provider configuration is [not yet supported](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn-operator/issues/43) in Krkn Operator. The scenarios above cannot be executed until cloud provider credential management is introduced. This page will be updated when that support becomes available.
